# xtce_generator
A tool to generate xtce files from a sqlite database. This database is assumed to have been generated by [jucier](https://github.com/WindhoverLabs/juicer). 
We follow the XTCE specifications described on **XTCE Verison 1.2** as per OMG document number:**formal/18-10-04**. You may find this document [here](https://www.omg.org/spec/XTCE/1.2/PDF).

[XTCE Patterns, Conventions and Caveats](#XTCE-Patterns-and-Conventions)

## Dependencies
`six==1.15.0`
`PyYAML~=5.3.1`
`setuptools~=50.3.2`
`flake8`
`twine`

**NOTE:** If you have issues running venv for python3.6 on Ubuntu 16, you should be able to fix it with this:
```
sudo apt install python3.6-venv python3.6-dev
```


## How to use 

Be sure to run this from a virtual environment:
```
python xtce_generator.py  --sqlite_path /home/vagrant/auto-yamcs/juicer/newdb --log_level ['DEBUG', 'INFO', `WARNING`, `ERROR`, `CRITICAL`, `SILENT`] --config_yaml /home/vagrant/xtce_generator/src/xtce_generator/config.yaml  --spacesystem ocpoc
```

After xtce_generator is done, you should have a file with the name of space_system_name.xml. In our case this is `ocpoc.xml` since we passed `ocpoc` as our root spacesystem.
Please beware that you may pass in any name for your spacesystem; this depends on your working context. It could be a vehicle name, machine architecture or the name of a space mission itself!


### Using The XML

The auto-generated xtce file, `ocpoc.xml` in our case, is ready for use for any ground system that is xtce-compliant. For now we use `yamcs`. Here is an example demonstrating such use:

1. Copy your xtce to your yamcs project:
```
cp ~/xtce_generator/src/ocpoc.xml /home/vagrant/yamcs-cfs/src/main/yamcs/mdb
```

2. Be sure to add this file to your `yamcs` instance file:

```
...
mdb:
    # Configuration of the active loaders
    # Valid loaders are: sheet, xtce or fully qualified name of the class
    - type: "xtce"
      spec: "mdb/cfs-ccsds.xml"
    - type: "xtce"
      spec: "mdb/CFE_EVS.xml"
    - type: "xtce"
      spec: "mdb/ocpoc.xml"

```

3. Then all you do is run yamcs!

```
mvn yamcs:run
```


## XTCE Compliance

In the future we will strive to be 100% xtce compliant. However, given that we use `yamcs` as our ground system, if there are quirks yamcs has we will be adhering to those quirks. For more info on this, you may go [here](https://docs.yamcs.org/yamcs-server-manual/mdb/loaders/xtce/).




### XTCE  Data Structures
Our xtce data structures are generated with `generateDS 2.36.2`. There is a quirk with this tool where it will be name `SpaceSystem` objects to  `SpaceSystemType` after generating the python code the xtce schema. This is very easy to fix.

Go to the `export` method of your  `SpaceSystemType`.
Change it from 
```
 def export(self, outfile, level, namespaceprefix_='', namespacedef_='', name_='SpaceSystemType', pretty_print=True):
```

to
```
 def export(self, outfile, level, namespaceprefix_='', namespacedef_='', name_='SpaceSystem', pretty_print=True):
```

After renaming that parameter, you are good to go! 
**NOTE: **Beware that if you do not change this, `yamcs` will *not* run.




# XTCE Patterns and Conventions <a name="XTCE-Patterns-and-Conventions"></a>
While we strive for 100% XTCE compliance, we lean towards YAMCS's version of XTCE, which is *almost* fully XTCE compliant. Below are the specifications of the patterns, naming conventions and overall structure we follow  to generate our XTCE files.


## Namespaces
As the XTCE standard mandates, our namespaces are enclosed with the `<xtce:SpaceSystem>` tag. More specfically, we have a `BaseType` namespace. This namespace has *all* of the necessary base types that a SpaceSystem may use. Please note that we use the terms `Namespace` and `SpaceSystem` interchangeably. A base type is something that is not *usually* user-defined, but is rather machine-defined. Below is a table with examples of base types that may be part of our `BaseType` namespace.

|Name | Description  | Size in bits   | Encoding   | Endianness   |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| uint1_LE | An unsigned integer. | 1   | unsigned  | Little Endian  |
|uint16_BE| An unsigned integer.  |  16 | unsigned  | Big endian   |
|char160_LE| A string with 160 bits, or 20 characters. | 160  | UTF-8  | Little Endian  |

Our naming conventions for base types will *always* be [type][number_of_bits][under_score][Endianness] just lke you see in the table above.

Please note that these base types are nearly identical to what you'd find in a programming language like C. That is because that is what they are meant to represent. Our goal is to auto-generate our XTCE files by extracting data(structs, variables, etc) from binary and executable files. Our reasons for this approach are simple; writing XTCE files by hand is error-prone and time consuming. At the moment the tool chain that will allow us to do this is *almost* done. One of those tools is [juicer](https://github.com/WindhoverLabs/juicer/tree/develop), which extracts DWARF data from ELF files, such as executable binary files. 

### ParameterTypes
Our paramter types are *always* defined under `<TelemetryMetaData>`. The naming of our parameter types follows the convention shown in the table above.

### ArgumentTypes
Our argument types, as per XTCE design and standard, are *always* defined under `<CommandMetaData>`. The naming of our arguments types follows the convention shown in the table above.


## User-defined Types
`EnumeratedParameterType`, `AggregateParamterType`, `AggregateArgumentType` and `EnumeratedArgumentType` types are what we consider user-defined types. This means that these types are *not* part of the `BaseType` namespace.  `EnumeratedParameterType` and `AggregateParamterType` types are *always* defined on `<TelemetryMetaData>`. `AggregateArgumentType` and  `EnumeratedArgumentType` are *always* defined on `<CommandMetaData>`. 

`AggregateArgumentType` members are flattened. This won't affect much of anything since the outcome is the same as if they were bundled inside an AAggregate.

## Arrays

### Arrays Inside Structures(*AggregateType)

**Standalone( that is it does not appear inside a structure) arrays are _not_ supported**  
The following is the example of a structure(`AggregateParamterType`) using an array:
```
                        <AggregateParameterType name="CFE_ES_MemPoolStats_t">
                            <MemberList>
                                <Member name="PoolSize" typeRef="BaseType/uint32_LE"/>
                                <Member name="NumBlocksRequested" typeRef="BaseType/uint32_LE"/>
                                <Member name="CheckErrCtr" typeRef="BaseType/uint32_LE"/>
                                <Member name="NumFreeBytes" typeRef="BaseType/uint32_LE"/>
                                <Member name="BlockStats" typeRef="BaseType/Array_16Dim__simlink_core_cfe_cfe_es_CFE_ES_BlockStats_t"/>
                            </MemberList>
                        </AggregateParameterType>
```
Here we have a structure called `CFE_ES_MemPoolStats_t`(notice the naming convention explained above). It has an array called BlockStats which points to an array in BaseType namespace.  
The way arrays are constructed was heavily inspired by [DWARF4](https://dwarfstd.org/doc/DWARF4.pdf) and [XTCE](https://www.omg.org/spec/XTCE/1.2/PDF) standards.

## Base types(Intrinsic types)
The types shown above such as uint16_LE are what is known as a base type. These are the types that represent things like int, float, char, etc in code. As mentioned above these *will* always be part of the `BaseType` namespace. Below is a table with all of our base types. Please note that this table is subject as we have not fully standarized our xtce format yet.
The endianness cells marked with a "*" at the end are _exclusively_ describing _just_ bit ordering and NOT byte-ordering.
As you see on the table this just applies to the types that are 8 bits or less as byte-ordering is irrelevant for these.
We consider _bit_ ordering for all of our types for the rare case where there is an architecture that takes into count bit ordering.

## Caveats
- The name `string` is special. Any type in the database with the type name of `string` is assumed to be a string
  and parsed as such by the XTCE tool. This means do *not* do things like this in code:  
  ```
  struct string
  {
    char buffer[64];
  };
   ```

## YAMCS-XTCE Quirks
Our xtce flavor adheres to yamcs. In the future, we'll try our best to design our toolchain in such a way we can
be 100% compliant with `xtce`, but at the moment we adhere to yamcs-flavored xtce _only_. As a result of this, we will 
need to deal with any quirks this yamcs-flavored xtce standard may have. Below are a list of quirks we've discovered
so far:
- It seems that yamcs has issues processing any `Paramter` entries that have a '#' in the name.

# Testing
All testing of this tool is done with [auto-yamcs](https://github.com/WindhoverLabs/auto-yamcs)
